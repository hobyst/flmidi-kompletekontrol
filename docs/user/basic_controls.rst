Basic controls
==============
.. note::
  The buttons on the Komplete Kontrol keyboards and pretty much every Native Instruments device can either be single-function buttons or
  buttons with secondary functions that get reached by using the SHIFT button of the device.

.. note::
  Any other buttons not listed here are either documented in other sections of this manual or not available to DAW developers and locked just
  to be used with Komplete Kontrol or Maschine.

- :green:`PLAY:` Toggle play and pause (will light up when playback is active)

- :green:`Restart:` Toggle between Pattern playback and Song playback

- :red:`REC:` Toggle recording on/off (will light up when enabled)

- :red:`Count-In:` Toggle "Countdown before recording" on/off (will light up when enabled)

- **STOP:** Stops playback and goes to the beginning of the song

- **CLEAR:** Emulates the Delete (Del) button on your keyboard. Active on all windows, actually usable and only lit up when the Piano roll window is focused

- **LOOP:** Toggle "Loop recording" on/off (lit up if enabled)

- **METRO:** Toggle the metronome on/off (lit up if enabled)

- **TEMPO:** Button for tempo tapping

- **UNDO and REDO:** Self explanatory

- **QUANTIZE:** Applies quantization to notes on the currently selected pattern. For more information and configuration, please check the ``config.py`` file.

- **AUTO:** Doesn't work (`see issue #5 <https://github.com/hobyst/flmidi-kompletekontrol/issues/5>`__). Instead, it shows the full-screen plugin browser.

- **TRACK (only on A-Series and M-Series):** Switches to the mixer mode when the keyboard is on MIDI mode (SHIFT + PLUG-IN) or is controlling a
  Komplete Kontrol or Maschine instance inside FL Studio.

- **INSTANCE:** Allows manual switching between Komplete Kontrol and Maschine instances. Works on A-Series and M-Series under any condition,
  but on S-Series it is disabled while the DAW integration is enabled since the DAW is supposed to tell the keyboard which instance to focus on.
  Since version 3 of the script, the keyboard will focus whatever instance of Komplete Kontrol is selected on the Channel rack, so the use of the
  INSTANCE button isn't needed.

- **PLUG-IN:** Changes the focus of the keyboard from DAW control mode to Komplete Kontrol mode.

- **MIDI:** Changes to MIDI mode.

- **4D Encoder:** It is mostly used for general navigation as both a directional pad and as a jog wheel. In the channel rack you can press it down like a button to
  open and close the window of the currently selected plugin and on the playlist and piano roll you can spin it to change the position of the playback marker,
  among other uses.
